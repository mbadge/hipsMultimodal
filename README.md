# Deep Learning Hip Fracture (using Confounders)

## About
This repo contains code used to investigate the interplay between
deep learning representations of hips radiographs with abstracted
patient, disease (fracture), and healthcare process variables
(e.g., which scanner was used to acquire the radiograph).
